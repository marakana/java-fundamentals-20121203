Java Fundamentals: Dec 3 - 7 2012
=================================

Best Practices
--------------

Maintainability:

  * Consider block depth and method length as useful measures of code complexity.
  * If a method is too deep or too long, refactor it: extract helper methods.

Class Recipe:

  * `private` fields (mostly immutable, `final` fields whenever possible)
  * Constructor to initialize immutable (and possibly other) fields
  * Getter methods and setter methods
  * Object identity: `hashCode` and `equals`
  * Optionally: other methods
